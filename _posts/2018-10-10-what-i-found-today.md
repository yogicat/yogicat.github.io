Since last night I started to read [Just Kids](https://amzn.to/2A1R9He "Just Kids") written by Patti Smith. I didn't know who she was until today. I heard [Seth Godin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin "Seth Godin") highly recommended this book from some podcast episode. It was on my kindle for a while and finally able to read thanks to the sleepless night.

I found myself deeply engaged with her childhood story as if I were with her all along. I love her way of expressing her feelings, how she explains the atmosphere, nature and even tiny little details.

It has been a while since I met such a book that couldn't wait to read more.

I met this [cool list ](https://nomoregoogle.com/ "no more google")from [product hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/ "Product hunt"). It's called **No More Google,** listing the alternatives to google.

Recently Google said that it would shut down Google Plus after it discovered a security vulnerability that exposed the private data.
